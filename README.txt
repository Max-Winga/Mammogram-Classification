README for final project code BIOE485

Download project data from: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70230508

-The download uses NBIA Data Retriever to install "Images (DICOM, 22.9 GB)" from the webpage

-Also download "Clinical data (XLSX)" (will be a file called CMMD_clinicaldata_revision.csv) from the webpage

-Once NBIA is done you will have a folder called manifest-1616439774456 (not sure if the number changes)

-Inside this folder is a folder called CMMD and the other is metadata.csv

-Place CMMD_clinicaldata_revision.csv in the manifest folder

-Place all of the python notebooks in the manifest folder 

-Now inside the manifest folder you should have: CMMD (folder), metadata.csv, CMMD_clinicaldata_revision.csv, and the notebooks

-Now run through the notebooks in order of the number in brackets at the start of the name (ex. start with "[0] Data Setup.ipynb")
 you can skip [4], [8], [9], and [10] as they are not used in the final report

If there are any issues with loading the data please email mwinga2@illinois.edu
